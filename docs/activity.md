Still not building. Railway logs show tsx not found. Please fix.

# My Actions

- **üêõ Fix Runtime Dependency Issue**: Moved `tsx` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in `backend/package.json` so it is installed in the production environment on Railway.

# User Prompt

Please implement this quick fix for me

# My Actions

- **üöë Fixed Railway Build Errors**: Updated `backend/tsconfig.json` to exclude demo files `src/test.ts` and `src/twelveLabs.ts` from TypeScript compilation to resolve build errors on Railway.

# User Prompt

I want to change the manipulation likelihood value by being the average of all the confidence values in the TwelveLabs JSON response.

# My Actions

- **üéØ Updated Manipulation Likelihood Calculation**: Changed the hardcoded manipulation score (34%) to be calculated as the average of all confidence values from the TwelveLabs JSON response clips
- **üîß Fixed Data Access Issues**: Corrected the code to properly access clips through `conversation.analysis.clips` instead of the incorrect `conversation.clips` path
- **üìä Dynamic Score Calculation**: Implemented `calculateManipulationLikelihood()` function that:
  - Gets all confidence values from the analysis clips
  - Calculates the average confidence score
  - Returns a rounded percentage value
- **üêõ Resolved Linter Errors**: Fixed TypeScript errors related to accessing non-existent properties on the Conversation type
- **‚ôªÔ∏è Improved Code Structure**: Reorganized code to ensure proper execution order of variable declarations and calculations

This is incorrect. I want to make sure that it always follows the format described in @prompt.txt . Please add a step that makes sure this JSON format is followed before inserting into the SUpabase row.

# My Actions

- **üîç Identified JSON Format Issue**: The TwelveLabs API response was being stored directly into Supabase without validation, leading to malformed data that didn't match the expected schema from `prompt.txt`
- **‚úÖ Added Comprehensive JSON Validation**: Created a `validateAnalysisData` function that ensures the JSON data follows the exact schema specified in `prompt.txt` before insertion into Supabase
- **üîß Validation Checks Implemented**:
  - Validates that data contains a `clips` array
  - Ensures each clip has all required fields: `startTime`, `endTime`, `transcript`, `tactic`, `justification`, `confidence`, `solution`
  - Validates time format (HH:MM:SS.ss or HH:MM:SS)
  - Ensures `tactic` is one of the 6 allowed manipulation tactics
  - Validates `confidence` is a number between 0-100
  - Ensures all text fields are strings
- **üîÑ Integrated Validation at Multiple Points**:
  - **Frontend Supabase Integration** (`src/lib/supabase.ts`): Validates data before `updateConversationAnalysis`
  - **Backend Video Processor** (`backend/src/videoProcessor.ts`): Validates data before returning analysis results
  - **Frontend TwelveLabs Processing** (`src/lib/twelveLabs.ts`): Validates data before returning results
- **üö® Error Handling**: If validation fails, the system throws descriptive errors explaining exactly what's wrong with the data format
- **üìä Data Sanitization**: The validation function also sanitizes the data by ensuring only the expected fields are present and in the correct format
- **üõ°Ô∏è Data Integrity**: This ensures that all data stored in Supabase follows the exact schema defined in `prompt.txt`, preventing display issues and data corruption

The validation system now acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring that only properly formatted JSON data that matches the expected schema gets stored in the database, preventing the malformed data issue you encountered.

# User Prompt

Please go with the simplified implementation

# My Actions

- **üéØ Major Architecture Simplification**: Eliminated the unnecessary backend server and moved TwelveLabs processing directly to the frontend
- **üì¶ Frontend Dependencies**: Added `twelvelabs-js` and `dotenv` packages to the main frontend package.json
- **üîß Created `src/lib/twelveLabs.ts`**: New frontend TwelveLabs processing module that:
  - Uses the TwelveLabs SDK directly in the browser
  - Processes videos via Supabase signed URLs (not local file paths)
  - Includes the analysis prompt directly in the code for simplicity
  - Provides the same progress callback interface as before
- **üîÑ Simplified `src/lib/supabase.ts`**: Replaced `processVideoWithBackend()` with `processVideoDirectly()` that:
  - Gets signed URL for the uploaded video
  - Calls the frontend TwelveLabs processing function directly
  - Eliminates all Server-Sent Events and HTTP API complexity
- **üì§ Updated `src/components/UploadPage.tsx`**: Changed to use `processVideoDirectly()` instead of the backend API
- **üóëÔ∏è Removed Unnecessary Backend Files**:
  - Deleted `backend/src/server.ts` (HTTP server)
  - Deleted `backend/src/videoProcessor.ts` (backend processing module)
  - Updated `backend/package.json` to remove server scripts
- **üîë Environment Configuration**: Added `VITE_TWELVE_LABS_API_KEY` to `.env.local` so the frontend can access the TwelveLabs API
- **üìä Simplified Architecture**: The new flow is much cleaner:
  1. User uploads video ‚Üí Supabase Storage ‚úÖ
  2. Frontend gets signed URL ‚Üí TwelveLabs SDK (directly) ‚úÖ
  3. Results saved to database ‚Üí Display in DeepInsightsPage ‚úÖ

This eliminates an entire layer of complexity while maintaining the same functionality. No more backend server needed!

# User Prompt

I now want to wire up the entire upload and processing flow.

An example of the TwelveLabs API response is in @twelvelabs-response.json.

When a user uploads a video in @UploadPage.tsx, that video will be sent to TwelveLabs via @pegasus.ts. The video will then replace the video in @DeepInsightsPage.tsx . The markers on the video timeline will be at the points indicated by "startTime" in the JSON response. The side menu information will include the startTime, endTime, transcript, tactic, justification, confidence, and solution from the JSON response.

# My Actions

- Created a comprehensive backend video processing system integrating TwelveLabs API with the frontend upload flow
- Built `backend/src/videoProcessor.ts` - a reusable module that processes videos using TwelveLabs, based on the existing `pegasus.ts` script but structured as a callable function with progress callbacks
- Created `backend/src/server.ts` - a simple HTTP server with Server-Sent Events support for real-time progress updates during video processing
- Updated `backend/package.json` to include server start scripts (`npm run server` and `npm start`)
- Enhanced `src/lib/supabase.ts` with:
  - Updated `updateConversationAnalysis` function to support `clips` (JSONB) and `processing_status` columns
  - Added `processVideoWithBackend` function that handles the complete flow: calls backend API, tracks progress via SSE, and updates database with results
- Completely rewired `src/components/UploadPage.tsx` to:
  - Replace simulated processing with real TwelveLabs processing via backend API
  - Track actual progress from TwelveLabs processing stages
  - Handle comprehensive error states for processing failures
  - Maintain the existing UI loading states while connecting to real backend
- Updated `src/components/VideoPlayer.tsx` to accept a `videoUrl` prop, allowing it to play actual uploaded videos instead of just the placeholder video
- Enhanced `src/components/DeepInsightsPage.tsx` with:
  - Real-time data loading from Supabase using conversation ID from URL params
  - Automatic transformation of TwelveLabs analysis results to match the component's expected format
  - Dynamic video URL loading from Supabase Storage with signed URLs
  - Loading and error states for better UX
  - Seamless fallback to mock data when analysis isn't available
- Added comprehensive error handling throughout the entire flow from upload to analysis display
- The complete flow now works as follows:
  1. User uploads video on UploadPage ‚Üí stored in Supabase Storage
  2. Conversation record created in database with `processing_status: 'processing'`
  3. Backend server downloads video and processes it with TwelveLabs API
  4. Real-time progress updates sent via Server-Sent Events
  5. Analysis results stored in `clips` JSONB column, status updated to 'complete'
  6. User redirected to /results, can navigate to /deep-insights
  7. DeepInsightsPage loads real video and analysis data, displays interactive timeline with actual manipulation detection results
- Updated `docs/activity.md` with this comprehensive implementation log

# My Actions

- Identified that the environment file was named `env.local` instead of `.env.local` (missing the leading dot)
- Renamed `env.local` to `.env.local` using `mv env.local .env.local` command
- This allows Vite to properly load the environment variables (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`)
- The issue was that Vite only automatically loads environment files that start with a dot (`.env`, `.env.local`, etc.)
- Updated `docs/activity.md` with this log entry

# User Prompt

have it instead read the txt file itself rather than just copy and pastrinng in the text

# My Actions

- Added file reading logic using `fsPromises.readFile()` to load the prompt text from the external file
- Added proper error handling for cases where the prompt file cannot be read
- Added console logging to confirm the prompt file is loaded successfully
- This approach allows for easy prompt modifications without changing the code
- Updated `docs/activity.md` with this log entry

- Updated the guidelines to instruct inclusion of the confidence score for each clip.
- Logged this activity in `docs/activity.md`.

put this in @prompt.txt

# My Actions

- Created a comprehensive prompt for AI video analysis software to detect six manipulation tactics: gaslighting, blame-shifting, emotional blackmail, self-presentation as victim, exaggeration/overstatement, and dominance/control
- Designed the prompt to work with scene-level vector embeddings and multimodal analysis (audio + video)
- Structured the output format as JSON with clips containing start/end times, transcripts, identified tactics, and justifications
- Added the complete prompt to `backend/prompt.txt` for use in the Gaslytics application
- Updated `docs/activity.md` with this log entry

# User Prompt

Also include a solution property to the JSON which gives a solution to deal with this tactic

# My Actions

- Added a `solution` field to the expected output JSON in `backend/prompt.txt`.
- Updated the guidelines to instruct inclusion of an actionable solution for each detected tactic.
- Logged this activity in `docs/activity.md`.

# User Prompt

Adjust my prompt. I want it to return moments where there is intense argument. Return in a structured JSON format: start and end times of where in the video intense argument takesp lace, transcription of the intense argument clip, a justification of how the model knows that intense argument takes place in that clip, and info of a healthy way to respond or deal with this scenario.

# My Actions

- Fixed linter errors in `backend/src/pegasus.ts` by removing invalid Task properties (`metadata`, `estimatedTime`, `processedFile`) that don't exist on the Task type
- Corrected the `client.analyze()` method call to use the proper signature with two parameters (videoId, prompt) instead of an object parameter
- Updated the analysis prompt to return structured JSON data with the following fields:
  - `start_time` and `end_time` for precise timestamps of intense argument moments
  - `transcription` of the actual dialogue during intense arguments
  - `justification` explaining how the model determined it was an intense argument
  - `healthy_response_advice` providing guidance on how to respond to such scenarios
  - A `summary` section with total count, overall patterns, and intervention recommendations
- The prompt now specifically looks for indicators like raised voices, interrupting, personal attacks, defensive language, emotional escalation, and manipulation tactics
- Updated console log messages to reflect the focus on "intense argument detection"
- Updated `docs/activity.md` with this detailed log entry

# User Prompt

Read the guide in @TwelveLabs_Quickstart_Search.ipynb. Create a test video search using TwelveLabs on the video in @/assets . Let me know if you have any questions. Keep in mind I am using the TwelveLabs node.js SDK instead of the Python SDK used in the guide.

# My Actions

- Read the TwelveLabs Python SDK guide in the Jupyter notebook to understand the workflow
- Found the correct Node.js SDK package name is `twelvelabs-js` (not just `twelvelabs`)
- Installed the `twelvelabs-js` package using `npm install twelvelabs-js`
- Completely rewrote `backend/src/twelveLabs.ts` to implement a comprehensive video search test using the Node.js SDK
- Adapted the Python guide workflow to Node.js, including:
  - Initialize TwelveLabs client with API key
  - Create an index with Marengo 2.7 model (visual + audio options)
  - Upload the `loveislandvid.mp4` video from the assets folder
  - Monitor the indexing progress
  - Perform multiple search queries relevant to the video content ("people talking", "emotional conversations", "drama and arguments", "romantic moments")
  - Display formatted search results with scores, timestamps, and confidence levels
- Added comprehensive error handling and user-friendly console output with emojis
- Fixed the TypeScript error by properly handling the API key validation
- Updated `docs/activity.md` with this detailed log

# User Prompt

`npm run dev` does not work. How come?

# My Actions

- Investigated the error message: `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` when running the `dev` script.
- Determined the issue was due to `ts-node` not handling TypeScript files in an ES Module environment.
- Installed `tsx` as a dev dependency to run TypeScript ESM files easily.
- Updated `backend/package.json` to replace the `dev` script with `"dev": "tsx src/twelveLabs.ts"`.
- Fixed `backend/src/twelveLabs.ts` by removing `console.log("Hello world")` and calling `makeApiRequest()`.
- Updated `docs/activity.md` with this log entry.
