`npm run dev` does not work. How come?

# My Actions

- Investigated the error message: `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` when running the `dev` script.
- Determined the issue was due to `ts-node` not handling TypeScript files in an ES Module environment.
- Installed `tsx` as a dev dependency to run TypeScript ESM files easily.
- Updated `backend/package.json` to replace the `dev` script with `"dev": "tsx src/twelveLabs.ts"`.
- Fixed `backend/src/twelveLabs.ts` by removing `console.log("Hello world")` and calling `makeApiRequest()`.
- Updated `docs/activity.md` with this log entry.

I have built an AI conversation analysis app called "Gaslytics". The purpose of the app is to analyze video recordings of users' arguments and return an anlysis.

Please conduct an analysis of my codebase and put it all in a new .md file within the @/docs folder.

# My Actions

- Created `docs/activity.md` to log my actions.
- Analyzed the codebase by examining the file structure and the content of each file in the `src` directory.
- Created a new file `docs/codebase-analysis.md` with a detailed analysis of the project.
- Updated this file, `docs/activity.md`, to document the steps taken.

In @todo.md write me a to do list which I can hand off to my team. Include the following points. Add more details where necessary. Organize it so that it is easy to digest.

- Redesign the landing page: make it look less AI generated. Include the following sections: Hero with a Start button, Video demo, marketing claims, FAQ.
- Break down the /results route page into two pages: keep the first page at the /results url and then add a nav button to go to the next page at the /highlights url. The results/ page will include the Conversation Summary, Mediators perspective, Detected patterns, and manipulation likelihood. The highlights/ page will include the video preview with the marked playback bar and quick jump to sections. It will have a sidebar which will include more analysis info when you jump to the marked sections (refer to the sample image attatched).
- Initialize and hook up a Supabase project to the frontend to store previous anlyses
- Implement TwelveLabs and Gemini processing pipeline. Hook up processing pipeline to the frontend to execture the pipeline and display the returned info.

# My Actions

- Created `docs/todo.md` with a detailed to-do list for the team.
- Updated this file, `docs/activity.md`, to document the steps taken.
